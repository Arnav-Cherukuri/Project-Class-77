        <h1>Project on Console</h1>
        <p>Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.</p>
        <p>You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript. The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console. To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.</p>
